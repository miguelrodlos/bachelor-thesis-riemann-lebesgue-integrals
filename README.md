# Bachelor’s Thesis: Riemann and Lebesgue Integrals

## Overview
This repository contains my Bachelor’s Thesis in Mathematics, titled  
**“The Riemann Integral and the Lebesgue Integral: A Comparative Study”**.

The thesis presents a rigorous theoretical and historical comparison between the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals, two fundamental frameworks in real analysis. While both aim to formalize the notion of integration, they differ substantially in their conceptual foundations, scope, and behavior under limiting processes.

## Abstract
The concept of integration is a central pillar of mathematical analysis, evolving from classical geometric problems to rigorous modern theories. This thesis undertakes a comparative and historically grounded study of the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals, introduced in the 19th and early 20th centuries, respectively.

The work examines their theoretical motivations, structural properties, and pedagogical significance. In particular, it analyzes integrability criteria, the classes of functions each theory admits, their convergence theorems, and the formulation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in both settings. The study highlights how Lebesgue’s measure-theoretic approach overcomes key limitations of Riemann integration and lays the foundation for modern analysis.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this thesis are:
- To provide a historical overview of the development of integration theories.
- To formally present the Riemann integral, including improper and multidimensional extensions.
- To develop the theory of the Lebesgue integral and its fundamental properties.
- To compare both frameworks with respect to convergence theorems and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
- To assess their conceptual and pedagogical roles in undergraduate mathematics education.

## Structure of the Thesis
The thesis is organized into four main chapters:

1. **Historical Foundations**  
   Evolution of the concept of integration from classical quadrature problems to the rigorous formulations of Riemann and Lebesgue.

2. **The Riemann Integral**  
   Formal construction, integrability conditions, improper integrals, and extensions to higher dimensions, including classical examples and limitations.

3. **The Lebesgue Integral**  
   Measure-theoretic foundations, measurable functions, construction of the integral, and the structure of Lebesgue integrable function spaces.

4. **Comparative Analysis**  
   Study of convergence theorems (Monotone and Dominated Convergence Theorems) and a comparison of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in both frameworks, with emphasis on absolute continuity.

## Methodology
The methodology is predominantly theoretical and expository. Definitions, propositions, and theorems are rigorously formulated and supported by proofs or standard references in real analysis. The work is based on classical and modern mathematical literature commonly used in undergraduate and graduate courses.

## Conclusion
The thesis shows that the Lebesgue integral constitutes a natural and powerful generalization of the Riemann integral, particularly in its ability to handle limit processes and integrate a broader class of functions. While Riemann integration remains essential for its geometric intuition and foundational role, Lebesgue integration is indispensable in modern mathematical analysis.
